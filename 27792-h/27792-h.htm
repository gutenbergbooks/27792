PREFACE
TO THE FIRST EDITION
</h2>
<p>
The greatest difficulty to be met in the
writing of an Indian play is the extensive
misinformation about Indians. Any real
aboriginal of my acquaintance resembles his
prototype in the public mind about as much
as he does the high-nosed, wooden sign of a
tobacco store, the fact being that, among
the fifty-eight linguistic groups of American
aboriginals, customs, traits, and beliefs differ
as greatly as among Slavs and Sicilians.
Their very speech appears not to be derived
from any common stock. All that they really
have of likeness is an average condition of
primitiveness: they have traveled just so far
toward an understanding of the world they
live in, and no farther. It is this general limitation
of knowledge which makes, in spite
of the multiplication of tribal customs, a
common attitude of mind which alone affords
a basis of interpretation.
</p>
<p>
But before attempting to realize the working
of Indian psychology, you must first rid
<a name="preface8" /><span class="pagenum">[Pg viii]</span>
yourself of the notion that there is any real
difference between the tribes of men except
the explanations. What determines man's
behavior in the presence of fever, thunder,
and the separations of death, is the nature of
his guess at the causes of these things. The
issues of life do not vary so much with the
conditions of civilization as is popularly
supposed.
</p>
<p>
Chiefest among the misconceptions of
primitive life, which make difficult any dramatic
presentation of it, is the notion that
all human contacts are accompanied by the
degree of emotional stress that obtains only
in the most complex social organizations.
We are always hearing, from the people
farthest removed from them, of &#8220;great primitive
passions,&#8221; when in fact what distinguishes
the passions of the tribesmen from
our own is their greater liability to the pacific
influences of nature, and their greater freedom
from the stimulus of imagination. What
among us makes for the immensity of emotion,
is the great weight of accumulated emotional
tradition stored up in literature and
art, almost entirely wanting in the camps of
the aboriginals. There the two greatest
themes of modern drama, love and ambition,
<a name="preface9" /><span class="pagenum">[Pg ix]</span>
are modified, the one by the more or less
communal nature of tribal labor, the other
by the plain fact that in the simple, open-air
life of the Indian the physical stress of sex is
actually much less than in conditions called
civilized.
</p>
<p>
When the critics are heard talking of &#8220;drama
of great primitive passions,&#8221; what they
mean is great barbaric passions, passions far
enough along in the process of socialization
to be subject to the interactions of wealth,
caste, and established religion, and still
free from the obligation of politeness. But
the life of the American Indian provides no
such conditions, and, moreover, in the factor
which makes conspicuously for the degree of
complication called Plot, is notably wanting,&mdash;I
mean in the factor of Privacy. Where all
the functions of living are carried on in the
presence of the community, or at the best
behind the thin-walled, leafy huts, human
relations become simplified to a degree difficult
for our complexer habit to comprehend.
The only really great passions&mdash;great, I
mean, in the sense of being dramatically
possible&mdash;are communal, and find their expression
in the dance which is the normal
vehicle of emotional stress.
<a name="preface10" /><span class="pagenum">[Pg x]</span>
</p>
<p>
In <i>The Arrow-Maker</i> the author, without
dwelling too much on tribal peculiarities,
has attempted the explication of this primitive
attitude toward a human type common
to all conditions of society. The particular
mould in which the story is cast takes shape
from the manner of aboriginal life in the
Southwest, anywhere between the Klamath
River and the Painted Desert; but it has
been written in vain if the situation has not
also worked itself out in terms of your own
environment.
</p>
<p>
The Chisera is simply the Genius, one of
those singular and powerful characters whom
we are still, with all our learning, unable to
account for without falling back on the primitive
conception of gift as arising from direct
communication with the gods. That she
becomes a Medicine Woman is due to the
circumstance of being born into a time
which fails to discriminate very clearly as to
just which of the inexplicable things lie
within the control of her particular gift.
That she accepts the interpretation of her
preëminence which common opinion provides
for her, does not alter the fact that she
is no more or less than just the gifted woman,
too much occupied with the use of her gift
<a name="preface11" /><span class="pagenum">[Pg xi]</span>
to look well after herself, and more or less at
the mercy of the tribe. What chiefly influences
their attitude toward her is worthy of
note, being no less than the universal, unreasoned
conviction that great gift belongs,
not to the possessor of it, but to society at
large. The whole question then becomes one
of how the tribe shall work the Chisera to
their best advantage.
</p>
<p>
How they did this, with what damage
and success is to be read, but if to be read
profitably, with its application in mind to
the present social awakening to the waste,
the enormous and stupid waste, of the gifts
of women. To one fresh from the consideration
of the roots of life as they lie close to the
surface of primitive society, this obsession
of the recent centuries, that the community
can only be served by a gift for architecture,
for administration, for healing, when it occurs
in the person of a male, is only a trifle
less ridiculous than that other social stupidity,
namely, that a gift of mothering must
not be exercised except in the event of a particular
man being able, under certain restrictions,
to afford the opportunity. There is
perhaps no social movement going on at
present so deep-rooted and dramatic as this
<a name="preface12" /><span class="pagenum">[Pg xii]</span>
struggle of Femininity to recapture its right
to serve, and still to serve with whatever
powers and possessions it finds itself endowed.
But a dramatic presentation of it is
hardly possible outside of primitive conditions
where no tradition intervenes to prevent
society from accepting the logic of
events.
</p>
<p>
Whatever more there may be in <i>The
Arrow-Maker</i>, besides its Indian color, should
lie in the discovery by the Chisera, to which
the author subscribes, that it is also in conjunction
with her normal relation for loving
and bearing that the possessor of gifts finds
the greatest increment of power. To such of
these as have not discovered it for themselves,
<i>The Arrow-Maker</i> is hopefully recommended.

NOTE
TO THE SECOND EDITION
</h2>
<p>
<i>The Arrow-Maker</i> was first published as
produced at The New Theatre, New York,
in the spring of 1911. In that edition certain
concessions were made to what was
thought to be the demand for a drama of
Indian life which should present the Indian
more nearly as he is popularly conceived.
</p>
<p>
After four years the success of the published
play as an authentic note on aboriginal
life as well as a drama suitable for
production in schools and colleges, seems to
warrant its publication in the original form.
As it now stands, the book not only conforms
to the author's original conception of the
drama, but to the conditions of the life it
presents.
</p>
<p>
With the addition of notes and glossary
it is hoped the present edition will meet
every demand that can be made on an honest
attempt to render in dramatic form a
neglected phase of American life.

ACT FIRST
</h2>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>The hut of the</i> <span class="smcap">Chisera</span>, <i>in the foot-hills
of the Sierras. It stands at the mouth
of a steep, dark cañon, opening toward the
valley of Sagharawite. At the back rise
high and barren cliffs where eagles nest;
at the foot of the cliffs runs a stream, hidden
by willow and buckthorn and toyon.
The wickiup is built in the usual Paiute
fashion, of long willows set about a circular
pit, bent over to form a dome, thatched
with reeds and grass. About the hut lie
baskets and blankets, a stone metate, other
household articles, all of the best quality;
in front is a clear space overflowing with
knee-deep many-colored bloom of the California
spring. A little bank that runs from
the wickiup to the toyon bushes is covered
with white forget-me-nots. The hearth-fire
between two stones is quite out, but the
deerskin that screens the opening of the hut
is caught up at one side, a sign that the</i>
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>
<i>owner is not far from home, or expects to
return soon.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>At first glance the scene appears devoid of life,
but suddenly the call of a jay bird is heard
faintly and far up the trail that leads to
the right among the rocks. It is repeated
nearer at hand, perfectly imitated but with
a nuance that advises of human origin,
and two or three half-naked Indians are
seen to be making their way toward the
bottom of the cañon, their movements so
cunningly harmonized with the lines of the
landscape as to render them nearly invisible.</i>
<span class="smcap">Choco</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Pamaquash</span> <i>with two
others come together at the end of the bank
farthest from the</i> <span class="smcap">Chisera's</span> <i>hut.</i>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Choco</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Who called?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Pamaquash</span><br />
</p>
<p>
It came from farther up.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Choco</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Yavi, I think.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Pamaquash</span><br />
</p>
<p>
He must have seen something.
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Choco</span><br />
</p>
<p>
By the Bear, if the Castacs have crossed
our boundaries, there are some of them shall
not recross it!
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Pamaquash</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Hush&mdash;the Chisera&mdash;she will hear you!
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Choco</span><br />
</p>
<p>
She is not in the hut. She went out toward
the hills early this morning, and has not yet
returned. Besides, if the Castacs have
crossed, we cannot keep it from the women
much longer.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Pamaquash</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Who has moved up to a better post of observation.</i>)
There is some one on the trail.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
(<i>The jay's call is heard and answered
softly by</i> <span class="smcap">Pamaquash</span>.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Choco</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Yavi. But Tavwots is not with him.
(<span class="smcap">Yavi</span> <i>comes dropping from the cliffs.</i>) What
have you seen?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Yavi</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Smoke rising&mdash;by Deer Leap. Two long
puffs and a short one.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
(<i>The news is received with sharp, excited
murmurs.</i>)
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Pamaquash</span><br />
</p>
<p>
More than a score&mdash;and with all our
youths we cannot count so many.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Choco</span><br />
</p>
<p>
And this business of war leader still unsettled&mdash;The
Council must sit at once. Go,
one of you, and tell Chief Rain Wind that
Tavwots has signaled from Deer Leap that
more than a score of Castacs are out against
us.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Pamaquash</span><br />
</p>
<p>
And tell the women to prepare a gift hastily
for the Chisera. Who knows how soon
we shall have need of her medicine.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
(<i>One of the Indians departs on this
errand.</i>)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Choco</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Never so much need of it as when we have
neglected our own part of the affair! Even
before the Castacs began to fill up our springs
and drive our deer, we knew that the Chief
is too old for war; and now that the enemy
has crossed our borders we are still leaderless.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Pamaquash</span><br />
</p>
<p>
So we should not be if we had followed the
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>
tribal use and given the leadership to years
and experience. It is you young men who
have unsettled judgment, with the to-do you
have made about the Arrow-Maker.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Choco</span><br />
</p>
<p>
I have nothing against years and experience,
but when one has the gods as plainly
on his side as Simwa&mdash;
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Yavi</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Never have I seen a man so increase in
power and fortune&mdash;
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Pamaquash</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Huh&mdash;huh! I too have watched the
growth of this Simwa. Also I have seen a
gourd swelling with the rains, and I have not
laid it to the gods in either case. But the
Council must sit upon it. We must bring it
to the Council.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Yavi</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Hotly.</i>) Why should you credit the gods
with Simwa's good fortune since he himself
does not so claim it? For my part, I think
with the Arrow-Maker, that it is better for a
man to thrive by his own wits, rather than
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>
by the making of medicine or the wisdom of
the elders.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Pamaquash</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>From above.</i>) Tst&mdash;st, Tavwots!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
(<span class="smcap">Tavwots</span> <i>comes down the cañon panting
with speed. He drops exhausted on the
bank, and</i> <span class="smcap">Yavi</span> <i>gives him water between
his palms from the creek.</i>)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Choco</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Have they crossed?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Tavwots</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Between Deer Leap and Standing Rock&mdash;more
than a score, though I think some of
them were boys&mdash;but they had no women.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Choco</span><br />
</p>
<p>
They mean fighting, then!
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Yavi</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Well, they can have it.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Tavwots</span><br />
</p>
<p>
But they should not be let fatten on our
deer before they come to it. Winnemucca,
whom I left at Deer Leap, will bring us word
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>
where they camp to-night. In the mean time
there is much to do.      <span class="dirright">(<i>Rising.</i>)</span>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Choco</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Much. No doubt Simwa will have something
to suggest.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Tavwots</span><br />
</p>
<p>
The Arrow-Maker is not yet war leader,
my friend. I go to the Chief and the Council.
      <span class="dirright">(<i>He goes.</i>)</span>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Choco</span><br />
</p>
<p>
And yet, I think the Chief favors Simwa,
else why should he prefer to put the election
to lot rather than keep to the custom of the
fathers?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Yavi</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Going.</i>) There might be reasons to that,
not touching the merits of the Arrow-Maker.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Pamaquash</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Tavwots has met the women!

<p>
They are coming to the Chisera. We
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>
should not have let them find us here; they
will neglect their business with her to beset
us with questions.
</p>
<blockquote>

No nearer than Pahrump. Not so near by

The best the camp affords. Think you we

<p>
(<i>Gathering flowers.</i>) Aye, but that was
mere women's matters, weevil in the pine
nuts, a love-charm or a colicky child. <i>This is
war!</i>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Seegooche</span><br />

(<i>Still peering about.</i>) As if that were not a
woman's affair also!
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Tiawa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
You may well say that! It was in our last
quarrel with Castac I lost the only man-child
I ever had, dead before he was born. When
the women showed me his face, it was all
puckered with the bitterness of that defeat.
You may well say a woman's matter!

<p class="nowrap">

<p>
That was the year my husband was first
made Chief, and we covered defeat with victory,
as we shall again. It was Tinnemaha,
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>
the father of the Chisera, went before the
gods for us, I remember.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Tiawa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Well for us that he taught her his strong
medicine. Not a fighting man from Tecuya
to Tehachappi but trusts in her.

well feathered and fly so swiftly to the mark.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Seegooche</span><br />

Simwa! Why, he scoffs at charms and

<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Tiawa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Giving the others to drink from her cap.</i>)
Aye; Simwa puts not faith in anybody but
Simwa.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Seegooche</span><br />
</p>
<p>
And with good reason, for he is the most
skillful of the tribesmen. He has made all

Aye, that is the talk in the wickiups, that

But you will bring a blessing on the battle?
Oh, Chisera, they do not tell us women, but
we hear it whispered about the camp that
the men of Castac are five and twenty, and
even with the youths who go to their first
battle we cannot make a score of ours. It is

I had already made medicine a night and a

</p>
<p>
Oh, then I lived in the dream of you.
When I ran in the trails, my heart expected
you at every turn, and in the dark of the hut
the sense of you brooded on my sleep. But
I thought it was all for the gods.
<a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Fatuously.</i>) Until I came.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Did I tell you, Simwa, that day when first
you found me dancing in the sun&mdash;you had
been gathering eagle's feathers for your
arrows, do you remember?&mdash;I thought that
day that you were of the gods yourself, for I
was sick with longing, and the spring was in
my blood.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
And when I came again, what did you
think?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
That you were the man most deserving
their favor, and that all the medicine I had
learned until then was merely that I might
persuade them for your sake.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Sitting up.</i>) Chisera, when you go up to
the Friend of the Soul of Man, you cannot
be always asking for the tribespeople. Do
you not sometimes ask for yourself?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
What should I ask for when I have your
love?
<a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
For friends, perhaps, who are to be rewarded,
or those who have done you injuries?      <span class="dirright">(<i>Watching her.</i>)</span>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Laughing.</i>) Once, Simwa, before I was
sure of you, I made a singing medicine to
draw you from the camp. And you came,
Arrow-Maker of Sagharawite, you came.
(<i>Laying her hands on his bosom.</i>) Did you
not feel me draw you?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Often and often, as it were a tie-rope in
my bosom between us. (<i>Letting go her hands
and stretching himself preparatory to rising.</i>)
But I did not think it was your medicine.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
What then?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Rising and walking about.</i>) Your beauty
and the wonder of your dancing.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Tell me, Simwa, in the beginning I know
you did not believe; but now you understand
<a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>
the power I have from the Friend of the Soul
of Man?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Surely; now that I am about to be made
war leader by means of it.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Rising and going back to the feathering of

women gossiping at the spring&mdash;
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
What did they say?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
That Simwa does not believe in charms
and scoffs at the gods.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
That was true (<i>recovering</i>)&mdash;once. But
now that I am become the most notable
arrow-maker in Sagharawite&mdash;
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Now&mdash;now you do not scoff at the Chisera?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Embarrassed.</i>) But it is not always well
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>
for a man to say what he thinks. If I were
to tell in the campody whence my good fortune
is, would not Padahoon do me some
mischief for it?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
But, Simwa, am I never to come to you as
other women to the wickiups of their husbands?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
What need, Chisera, when I come so often
to yours?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
The need of women to serve openly where
they love.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
But what service could you do me when
you had lost the respect of the tribesmen?
You know the tribal custom. It is not for the
friend of the gods to dig roots and dress
venison.

and I know not why it should seem strange
to others that I should know love as&mdash;as we

Not by his name, but by the way he looked

</p>
<p>
How was that?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">

<p>
As every lover looks to every maid&mdash;tall

and strong and straight of back. Even as
you look to me, Beloved.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">

(<i>Relieved, giving back the amulet.</i>) May

to look as favorably on me as you do.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />

But you have no enemies.

<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
The Sparrow Hawk, without doubt.
Could you give me a curse for him?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Rising.</i>) Ah, you should not have asked
me that. Never since my father died have I
thought to regret that he did not teach me
the making of evil medicine. Would I had
all the curses in the world! (<i>Turning piteously
to him.</i>) But you do not love me any
the less because I have not one little, little
curse to give you?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
No, it is nothing. No curse can reach me
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>
past your blessing. But I would not have
thought the old man would leave you wholly
unprotected. Why, even I could wrong you,
and, without a curse (<i>trying to speak lightly</i>)
you could not punish me for it.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
If no one does me no more wrong than you,
Simwa, I need no cursing. But, in truth, my
father did give me&mdash;Ah, now I have
thought of another gift for you, Arrow-Maker
of Sagharawite! Before he died, the
medicine man, my father&mdash;did I not tell
you? (<i>she rummages eagerly in her medicine
bag</i>)&mdash;gave me this magic arrow against
my evil hour. (<i>Drawing it out.</i>) See how
heavy it is, and how the blood drain is cut
in a medicine writing round and round the
shaft.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
What magic has it?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
That however far and feebly it is shot, it
flies straight to the mark, over hills and high
mountains, in the dark or light, and death
rides upon its shaft. (<i>Laughing.</i>) Why, you
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>
could kill even me with this arrow. See, I
have tied it in your quiver, so that you may
not mistake it and shoot it away on any
slight occasion. It is my latest gift to you,
Beloved.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Simwa</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the gift, Chisera. Now give
me the quiver. I must join the others before

There should be a matter of two doeskins,
tanned white and fine (<i>he produces them from

Look, Chisera!

A war leader, Chisera, should be neither
old and timid, nor young and overbold, but
of middle years and discretion; not so hot in
his heart that his head cannot reason with it,
nor so reasonable that it cools his heart.

Are the gods a-cold, Padahoon, that you

It is a little matter, Chisera; a handful of

the blanket is very thick. Shall I leave it a

</p>
<p>
(<i>Reluctantly putting up the bribe; after a

<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Chisera, we have had peace now at Sagharawite
so many summers that scarcely a
man of us besides myself has seen battle;
also we are a little outnumbered. Have
you thought, Chisera, what will come to
Sagharawite if we go out under an untried
leader?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
What will come will be as the gods determine.
What reason have you to think they
will favor you more than Simwa?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
It is my experience, Chisera, that the gods
are inclined to the better man. And, look
you, Chisera, this is perhaps my last chance
to serve my people. Comes another war, if
there are enough of us left after this to make
another war possible, I shall be too old for
leadership. And I have that in me which I
would prove before I die. This is man-talk,
Chisera. Do you understand it?

<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Simwa put trust in the gods! Simwa believe
that by singing and dancing and waving
of arms, with a rag of buckskin and a
hair of your head and three leaves of a seldom-flowering
plant, you can turn the fortunes
of war? This will be news for the
fighting men, Chisera.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />

(<i>Quivering, but controlling herself.</i>) Padahoon,

(<i>Rising.</i>) Tribesmen, for as many years as
a fir tree needs to bear cones, I have been
Chief in Sagharawite. Now I am old, and,
like a badger, see only my own trail (<i>grunts

than my eyes see. Therefore, since there is
war with Castac concerning the piñon trees
which are ours (<i>grunts and exclamations</i>), it is
right you have a younger man to lead you.
But, since it has never happened that there
must be a war leader chosen while there is a
chief alive and sitting in Council, I think it
<a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>
well to inquire how the gods stand toward us.

gods have high affairs; they are not always
listening to the gossip of the camp-fire and

except as the Chisera carries it? If we put
the choice to them, let her know what we

(<i>Rising.</i>) Chief and tribesmen, you know
me. What I think in my heart, I say; and
what I say I do. The
pi&ntilde;on
trees are ours,
since the time of our father's fathers (<i>general
assent</i>), and this is a vain fight for the men of
Castac. Inasmuch as they have crossed our
borders, they do evilly, but they are also
Paiutes, as we are, and sons of the Bear.
Aforetime when the Tecuyas came against
us, they were as our brothers. Now, were I
war leader, I should leave them at Pahrump
and, going up behind the ridge of Toorape,
strike at their villages. When we have their
women and children and their stores, we can
make terms with our brothers of Castac. So
shall we save our honor and our allies.

and is a poacher my fellow that I should
respect him? Sons of the Bear are the men of
Castac? Aye, bastard sons, and the coyote is
their mother. (<i>Grunts and cries of approval.</i>)
The Castacs have filled up our springs and
driven our deer. They have stalked our
hunters in the hills. (<i>Grunts.</i>) Aye, but we
have given the stalkers arrows of ours to
keep. (<i>Grunts of satisfaction.</i>) Shall we go
after our arrows, men of Sagharawite, or
shall we wait until our &#8220;brothers&#8221; of Castac
come and stroke us? I am not so old as
Padahoon, nor so wise, but, by the Bear that
fathered us, were I war leader for the space

I wished it so, but Simwa has no faith in

wavings of arms.

Tavwots, you have eaten meadowlarks'

not have a wife already, I should think he
had an eye to her. The best cut of my next

Tavwots, your wit misleads you. The

us.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Tavwots</span><br />

<p>
Well, the gods have a handsome advocate.
I should give her anything she asked. (<i>Looking

They have forbidden all the campodies

None, I think, except that they are able.
A bowman of Tehachappi inquired of me

The fortunes of Simwa! What are they
but the accidents of time and weather. A

<p>
Understand yourself that whatever comes

Friends and tribesmen, the fortune of
Simwa is Simwa. Does the Bear take weapons
against the woodchuck, and shall the
sons of the Bear make charms against their
enemies? The spoil of Castac is in our camp
(<i>cheers</i>) and our young men hunt within
their borders. (<i>Applause.</i>) If any of the
tribes inquire where are the fullest harvests,
the fattest deer, the prettiest maidens (<i>he
flings his blanket about</i> <span class="smcap">Bright Water</span>), bid
him look for the land of Simwa the Arrow-Maker.

a girl, rubbing his cheek against

Come this way, Chisera. The girls are out
on the <i>mesa</i>, dancing with the bride, and the
women are grinding at the metate for the
marriage feast.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
But where is Simwa?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
With the bride, no doubt. Here is his
wickiup, and here the marriage dower beside
it.
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
All this?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Never so many gifts went to a wedding in
Sagharawite. Every woman whose man
came back safe from the war gave a basket
or a blanket, and Simwa gave all of his share
of the spoil of Castac.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
And that, I doubt not, is bitter for you to
see, Padahoon.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Why, as to that, Chisera, it is good to see
spoil of our foes in the camp; but the fighting
men of Castac were our blood brothers. See,
here is the blanket where the newly married
pair shall sit to receive the blessings of the
fruitful women.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Bitterly.</i>) But not the blessing of the
Chisera. Never before, in my time, has there
been a bride of Sagharawite but sent to ask
my blessing.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Aye, but Simwa does not believe in charms
<a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>
and spells. (<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Chisera</span> <i>seems about to
break out angrily, but restrains herself.</i> <span class="smcap">Padahoon</span>
<i>watches her narrowly as he speaks.</i>)
Look, Chisera! Is not the bride fair? Fit to
set a man beside himself with desiring?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
She is but a child. Her breasts are scarcely
grown. No fit mate for a war leader.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Watching her.</i>) But a man so well furnished
with wisdom need not look for it in a
wife. Is it not so, Chisera?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Padahoon, why do you tell me this?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>With the appearance of candor.</i>) As often
as I came to your house to get medicine, you
asked me for news of the campody, and
seemed best pleased with news of Simwa, the
war leader; and with reason, since he has
become the most notable man of the Paiutes.
Yet, when I told you he was to be married
to-day to the Chief's daughter, you were slow
to believe. Now tell me if I have lied,
Chisera.
<a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
You have not lied, Padahoon, but Simwa,
he has lied. How long have you known this?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Since the time of Taboose.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
And why not told me?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
How could I think the Chisera wished to
know? It was a thing you might have heard
from the women grinding meal or weaving
baskets. But the Chisera does not often
come to the village, except there is illness.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
I have no time to gossip with the women.
I have to go before the gods for them and
their children.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />

Why should not one maid come to the
marriage of another? There is scarce two
summers' difference between me and the
Chief's daughter.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Yes, but you come in your blanket. Such
has not been your custom when you have
come among us on errands of healing; then
you dressed sumptuously, as befitted one
bearing the word of the gods. Now you come
like an angry woman who would hide what
is in her heart.
<a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>With dignity.</i>) Cover your own heart,
Padahoon, lest I ask what mischief breeds in
it to bid you observe me so much. I have not
forgot that you would have paid me a blanket
to be made war leader in the room of Simwa.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>With ugly insinuation.</i>) Ugh! huh! Perhaps
I had been as fortunate as the Arrow-Maker,
if, instead of giving it, I had offered
to share it with you.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />

<p>

try if I can curse.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
(<i>Conciliatory.</i>) I have no wish to anger the
friend of the gods, but I am a plain man
wishing good to my campody, and it seems
not good to me that Simwa has grown suddenly
so great.

<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />

<p>
I have known this Simwa since he was
first tied in a basket, and, though he has
grown to be war leader, I think he is most
like a pod of rattleweed that is swollen to
twice its size at the end of the season, yet
has no more in it than at the beginning. And
I do not know how, without the help of magic
medicine, he has come to be what he is with
so little in him.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">The Chisera</span><br />
</p>
<p>
The Chief's daughter has trusted him.
</p>

Know, then, that if these are your reasons,
Rain Wind, there is no more meat in them
than in the husk of acorns. If good fortune
hangs on all Simwa's movements, it is by
reason of the medicine I make that binds
him in the favor of the Friend.

</p>
<p>
(<i>Leaning on his elbows, with the manner of

your blessing, Chisera, if it is so; for it is
well known in the camp that Simwa, the
Arrow-Maker, does not believe in charms,
nor seek them.

The medicine of the Chisera is very powerful,
but one must allow a little credit to the
gods. Simwa was chosen war leader by the
trial of the seven sticks. As the gods willed,
they made the sticks to fall. Is it not so,
Chisera?

(<i>Sullenly, from her blanket.</i>) I do not know.
I did not look. (<i>Letting fall her blanket and

Friend to give victory to the war leader.
What should I care for the sticks? A day
and a night I made medicine, and the sign
was sure. I said &#8220;Simwa&#8221; and the gods
confirmed it.

throve only by her blessing?

any sign of shame on my face for all the

</p>
<p>
The truth?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Bright Water</span><br />
</p>
<p>
That you were the Chisera's lover for the
sake of what she could do for you, and your
denial left her no way to prove it except by
taking away the help of the gods from us all.
Is not that the truth?

Whatever is in any man's mind for the

Chief and tribesmen, once I gave counsel
and you despised it&mdash;
</p>
<p class="nowrap">

</p>
<p>
No more of that. Give counsel now.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
It is the same counsel, but time has not
mended the occasion. Penned here on the
edge of the precipice we can but starve. We
must break through our enemies and strike
at their women and their stores.
<a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 142]</span>
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Tavwots</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Every trail is watched. Not so much as a
weasel can go in and out from Toorape and
they not know it.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
With so many watchers, then, they cannot
have much of a fighting force at any point. In
an hour it will be dark; we shall go down by
Deer Leap with the women and children,
and stay not for fighting, but, fleeing for our
lives, break through to their villages&mdash;
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Choco</span><br />
</p>
<p>
But if they move on us to-night? If the
vultures have already betrayed us&mdash;even
now they may be within earshot?
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Tavwots</span><br />
</p>
<p>
If they come up with us before we reach
Deer Leap it is to run into the wolf's mouth.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
I have thought of that. To-night they expect
us to mourn our dead and go before our
gods&mdash;
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Chief</span><br />
</p>
<p>
So should we.

</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Padahoon</span><br />
</p>
<p>
That they may think so, leave one behind
to sound the medicine drum throughout the
night. So they shall fear to attack and expect
an easier victory in the morning when
we are exhausted with dancing to the gods.
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<span class="smcap">Tavwots</span><br />

THE DANCES
</h3>
<p>
All tribal or emotional occasions among Indians
are invariably accompanied by singing
and dancing. These are frequently derived from
the movements of animals and are both pantomimic
and symbolic.
</p>
<p>
The object of the medicine dance is to work
up the dancer to a state of trance, in which he
receives a revelation in regard to the matter
under consideration.
</p>
<p>
Some of these medicine dances are ritualistic
in character and must be performed with great
strictness, but in the case of the Chisera the dance
is assumed to be made up of various dance elements
expressing the emotion of the moment,
combined by individual taste and skill.
</p>
<p>
Power is supposed to descend upon the dancer
as he proceeds. Sometimes the dance lasts for
hours, and even for days before the proper
trance condition is attained. Even then the revelation
may not come until a second or third
climax has been reached.
</p>
<p>
The blanket dance is common throughout the
Southwest, and possibly elsewhere. It is accompanied
by a song which says, in effect, &#8220;How
lovely it will be when you and I have but one
blanket.&#8221; By the young people it is not taken
any more seriously than &#8220;drop the handkerchief&#8221;
and other courtship games.
<a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</span>
</p>

<a name="chapter14" />
COSTUMES
</h3>
<p>
While the scene of this play is laid among the
Paiute peoples, there is nothing which makes it
absolutely unlikely among any of the hunting
tribes.
</p>
<p>
Considerable latitude is therefore permissible
in costume and accessories. The only indispensable
thing is that all these should be kept within
a given culture area. Every article of Indian use
or apparel is determined by some condition of
living, and it is a mistake to mix costumes from
various tribes.
</p>
<p>
Concessions must be made to the objections
of the modern audience to the state of nudity
which would be natural to the time in which the
story is laid. But even making allowance for
this, the tendency is always to overdo, to have
too many beads and fringes and war-bonnets.
No more than his white brother did the Indian
wear all his best clothes every day.
</p>
<p>
The blanket is the most considerable item of
Indian equipment. At once by its quality, its
color, and its pattern it announces something of
the wearer's rank and condition.
</p>
<p>
The way in which it is worn betrays the state
of his mind as does no other garment. It is
drawn up, shrugged off, swung from one shoulder,
<a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>
or completely shrouds the figure according as his
mood runs, or it is folded neatly about the body
to get it out of the way of his arms when he has
need of them. Blankets would be worn to Council,
but not going to battle. They would be worn
by young and modest women on public occasions,
but by old women only for warmth and protection.
They are also worn as an advertisement of
the desire for privacy.
</p>
<p>
When an Indian is seen completely shrouded
in his blanket, standing or sitting a little apart
from the camp, he either has a grouch or he is
praying. In either case it is not good manners to
interrupt him.
</p>
<p>
As far as possible the use of the blanket is indicated
in the text. Always it may be safely
taken as an indication of the wearer's attitude
toward whatever is going on about him.
